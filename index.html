                <h3>Bio</h3>
                <p>My name is Nep Orshiso and I'm from Kansas City, MO. I'm an Ethiopian-American and I've lived in the Midwest most of my life. I have a B.S. in Finance and Marketing and a minor in Economics from Truman State University. </p>
                <p>I moved to Atlanta, GA to join the DigitalCrafts Full-Time Immersive Program to become a software developer. Previously, I worked at a large retirement services provider as a junior manager in their call center. I aim to become a Software Developer in January 2020 in Atlanta after completing the DigitalCrafts program.</p>

                <h3>Interests</h3>
                <p>Technology, Personal Finance, Economics, and Politics are subjects that interest me. I’m particularly interested in the intersection of technology and finance. </p>
                
                <p>I'm also a big fan of podcasts. They make commuting and exercise bearable.</p>

                <p>My Favorite Podcasts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>NPR: Planet Money & The Indicator</li>
                    <li>Freakonomics</li>
                    <li>Animal Spirits</li>
                    <li>FiveThirtyEight</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I like watching football and soccer. Being from Missouri, I'm a fan of the Kansas City Chiefs. Mahomes is the real deal. I also support Arsenal in the English Premier League.</p>

                <h3>Intent for website</h3>
                <p>I built this website as part of the pre-work assignments for my immersive program but I’d also like to expand on it and attach a blog to it. I’m going to treat this website as a testing ground and use the blog to document my journey and try out new technologies.</p>
