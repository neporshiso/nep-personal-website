# Nep's Personal Website

I built this website as part of the pre-work assignments for the DigitalCrafts Immersive Program. 

I’d also like to expand on it and attach a blog to it. 

I’m going to treat this website as a testing ground and use the blog to document my journey and try out new technologies.
